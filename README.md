## Blog Post
Our project's goal is to help predict timeframes when public transit is either delayed or cancelled.
This will help you arrive on time to the exam or one of the many crucial meetings you have.
Say 'Farewell!' to embarrassing delays!
Our product simply tells you to how likely your bus will be late, so you'll know to not take the last bus.
We will reveal unto you the innate randomness and chaos of the universe localized entirely in our public transport infrastructure!

Even better, you won't have to take chances at arriving on time as soon as the management team at HSL learns of our product.
After they have integrated our product into their application (and they totally will!), public transit will be late at least 90%* less. 
(*Data has been made up)

Our product will be expanded in the future to even take weather into account!
However, due to lack of funding on HSL's part, this feature has not yet been implemented,
Then our product will be able to predict when the extremely rare** occurrance of snowing!
(**HSL isn't aware that it snows in Finland)
